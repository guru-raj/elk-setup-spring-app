## Contribution Guidelines

# File under construction! (More info graphics to explain how to contribute and rules for the same.)

Meanwhile, the common guidelines/steps to contribute remain the same: 
1. Fork project
2. Take out a branch from master
3. Make changes and add commits (with relevant and appropriate commit messages)
4. Raise a pull request with changes you have made pointing to master
5. Explain the change you've made and mark the issues (if any the PR aims to solve)
6. Add a reviewer to get your PR reviewed


Happy contributing! :D
